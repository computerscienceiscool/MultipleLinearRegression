# Multiple Linear Regression for Customer Behavior Prediction

This Python code analysis delves into the usage of predictive analytics, specifically applying multiple logistic regression for customer behavior prediction in terms of bandwidth usage. The primary objective is to employ proactive strategies to predict churn usage, thereby optimizing the customer experience. 

**The analysis seeks to test a hypothesis: Can we use logistic regression as an efficient tool to predict churn usage given a specific dataset?**

*This includes the Python code and data analysis, but it does not include the write-up that I wrote.*
